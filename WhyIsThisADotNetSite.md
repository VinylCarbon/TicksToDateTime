You might be wondering: why did you make this an ASP.NET site when it's just
an html page?

Great question. There are three reasons:

1. I work with .NET every day and I love it; I'm comfortable with it.
2. It's super easy to publish to Azure. Like ridiculously easy. You don't have to use .NET to publish to Azure, but it's easier if you do.
3. When I started the project I thought I'd be taking advantage of at least _one_ .NET component. Maybe I will someday.

So, until I actually use a .NET feature, just accept the fact that it's a static page that arrives very quickly, and is absurdly small.
